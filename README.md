# A simple weather app, made during course work
This simple NodeJS and Handelbars project allows you to search for a location and get back a weather report.

The app takes your search, makes a gelocate API call to correctly retrieve the longitude and latitude of your search, and then makes a second API call to the dark sky API, finally presenting you with a forecast.
